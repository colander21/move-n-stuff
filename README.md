# Move-n-Stuff

## Overview
Move-n-stuff is a convenience application that allows users to effectively move their belongings from one place to another without losing track of items. Unlike moving companies who donâ€™t properly organize your stuff, our product lets the user arrange their items in ways that work for them, and know where everything is without needing to unpack.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/move-in-stuff-org/move-n-stuff.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
    ```
    cd move-n-stuff
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Create the following `.env` files:
   1. Inside `/packages/backend/` create a file named `.env` with the following variables:
       ```
       MONGO_URI=your-mongo-uri
       TOKEN_SECRET=token-secret-here
       ```
   2. Inside `/packages/frontend/` create a file named `.env` with the following variable:
      ```
      VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"
      ```

5. Run the application via one of the following options:
    1. Singular terminal (backend and frontend development mode in one):
      ```
      npm run dev
      ```
    2. Split terminals (backend and frontend development mode separate)
       - Terminal 1:
         ```
         npm run dev:back
         ```
       - Terminal 2:
         ```
         npm run dev:front
         ```
    3. Production mode (backend and frontend in one terminal):
       ```
       npm start
       ```

## Style Guide
For style we did the following:
- Installed Prettier VS Code extension, using its default settings. In VS Code settings we set "Prettier - Code formatter" as the default formatter under "Editor: Default Formatter", as well as turning on "Editor: Format On Save"
- For linting we used es-lint
- Both the above exist in the project and can be ran with the following:
  - Prettier:
    ```
    npm run format
    ```
  - ESLint:
    ```
    npm run lint
    ```
